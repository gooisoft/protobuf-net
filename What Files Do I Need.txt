protobuf-net can be used on multiple platforms, and many different builds are available.

In particular, though, there are 2 main uses:

- the "full" version, which includes as much type-model / runtime support as will work on your chosen platform
- the "core only" version, which includes just the fundamental reader/writer API and core objects

If you are on a rich framework like full .NET, the "full" version is entirely appropriate and will work fine.

However, if you are on a restricted framework (Silverlight, Phone 7, WinRT, etc) then many operations would either
be slow, or impossible. To address this, protobuf-net provides these frameworks with a "precompile" facility,
which moves all of the impossible / slow steps to a build-time operation, emitting a serialiation dll you
can reference and use (now very fast etc) from your chosen framework.

More information about the precompiler is here:

What do I need:

example: running on .NET 4.0

solution: copy the files from Full\net30. Note that protobuf-net does not require any 4.0 features, so using "net30" will
give you all of protobuf-net including WCF support (which is the difference between "net20" and "net30").


example: running on Silverlight 4

option 1: copy the files from Full\sl4, and accept that it isn't quite as optimal as it could be - but perfectly fine
for light-to-moderate serialization usage.

option 2: copy the files from CoreOnly\sl4, and use "precompile" (in the Precompile folder) at build-time to generate
a serialization assembly (this also needs to be referenced and deployed from you application).

Additional:

Note that each framework contains 3 files:

- protobuf-net.dll  the library itself
- protobuf-net.xml  intellisense xml, used by thre IDE when developing
- protobuf-net.pdb	debugging symbols, useful when debugging

Of these - the only one you **need** to deploy is the dll; the pdb may be useful for investigating crash reports. The
xml is used only by the IDE.
